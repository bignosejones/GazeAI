# GazeAI
Gaze AI java project created using Processing 4.0

This program renders two eyes that follow the mouse, react to the user, and perform in front of different backgrounds chosen by the user.
I created this program for the first project for my Robots Art and Culture class, AD417, and is very much a work in progress.
